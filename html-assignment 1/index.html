        Because YouTube auto-copyrights music from The Clash, I couldn't embed the video
        (at least not without getting a "video unavailable" frame), so I went with this alternative
        (i.e., hyperlinking a video in an image and adding a caption using <figure> and <figcaption>).-->

        <h3>Lyrics</h3>
            <p>You say you stand by your man<br>
            Then tell me something I don't understand<br>
            You said you love me, and that's a fact<br>
            But then you left me, said you felt trapped<br></p>
            
            <p>Well some things you can explain away<br>
            But the heartache's in me till this day</p>

            <p>[Chorus]:<br>
            Did you stand by me<br>
            No, not at all<br>
            Did you stand by me<br>
            No way</p>
            
            <p>All the times<br>
            When we were close<br>
            I'll remember these things the most<br>
            I see all my dreams come tumbling down<br>
            I can't be happy without you around</p>
            
            <p>So all alone I keep the wolves at bay<br>
            And there's only one thing that I can say</p>

            <p>[Chorus]</p>
            
            <p>You must explain why this must be<br>
            Did you lie when you spoke to me<br>
            Did you stand by me<br>
            No, not at all</p>
            
            <p>Now I got a job<br>
            But it don't pay<br>
            I need new clothes<br>
            I need somewhere to stay<br>
            But without all of these things I can do<br>
            But without your love, I won't make it through</p>
            
            <p>But you don't understand my point of view<br>
            I suppose there's nothing I can do</p>
            
            <p>[Chorus]</p>
            
            <p>You must explain why this must be<br>
            Did you lie when you spoke to me</p>
            
            <p>Did you stand by me<br>
            Did you stand by me<br>
            No, not at all<br>
            Did you stand by me<br>
            No way<br>
            Did you stand by me<br>
            No, not at all<br>
            Did you stand by me<br>
            No way</p>
