            <p>Nintendo Co., Ltd. is a Japanese multinational video game company headquartered in Kyoto. 
              It develops, publishes, and releases both video games and video game consoles.</p>
            <p>The company was founded in 1889 as Nintendo Koppai by craftsman Fusajiro Yamauchi and originally 
              produced handmade hanafuda playing cards. After venturing into various lines of business during the 1960s 
              and acquiring legal status as a public company, Nintendo distributed its first 
              console, the Color TV-Game, in 1977. It gained international recognition 
              with the release of Donkey Kong in 1981 and the 
              Nintendo Entertainment System and Super Mario Bros. in 1985.</p>
              <p>Since then, Nintendo has produced some of the most successful consoles in the video game industry, 
                such as the Game Boy and the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, and has created 
                some of the most beloved franchises, including Mario, Donkey Kong, 
                The Legend of Zelda, Starfox, and Metroid.</p>

    <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
      <div>
        <p>Nintendo's mission is to put smiles on the faces of everyone we touch. 
          We do so by creating new surprises for people across the world to enjoy together. 
          We've forged our own path since 1889, when we began making hanafuda playing 
          cards in Kyoto, Japan. Today, we're fortunate to be able to share our 
          characters, ideas, and worlds through the medium of video games and the 
          entertainment industry.</p>
