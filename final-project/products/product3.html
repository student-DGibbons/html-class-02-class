              <p>Super Mario World, known in Japan as Super Mario World: Super Mario Bros. 4, is a 1990 platform game 
                developed by Nintendo EAD and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES).
                 The player controls Mario on his quest to save Princess Peach and Dinosaur Land 
                 from the series' antagonist Bowser and the Koopalings.</p>
              <p>The gameplay is similar to that of earlier Super Mario games; players control Mario through a series of levels
                 in which the goal is to reach the goalpost at the end. 
                 Super Mario World introduces Yoshi, a ridable dinosaur who can eat enemies.</p>
                <p>Super Mario World is often considered one of the best games in the series and is cited
                   as one of the greatest video games ever made. It sold more than twenty million copies worldwide, 
                   making it the best-selling SNES game.</p>
