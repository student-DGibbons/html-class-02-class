                <div class="row">
                  <p>The 16-bit design of the Super NES incorporates graphics and sound co-processors
                    that perform tiling and simulated 3D effects, a palette of 32,768 colors, and 8-channel
                      ADPCM audio. These base platform features, plus the ability to dramatically extend 
                      them all through substantial chip upgrades inside of each cartridge, 
                      represent a leap over the 8-bit NES generation and some significant advantages over 
                      16-bit competitors.</p>

                <h3><span></span>CPU & RAM</h3>
                <div class="row">
                  <p>The CPU is a Ricoh 5A22, a derivative of the 16-bit WDC 65C816 microprocessor advantages advantages and 
                    This CPU has an 8-bit data bus and two address buses. The 24-bit "Bus A" is designated for general
                    accesses, and the 8-bit "Bus B" can access support chip registers, such as the video and audio co-processors.
                    </p>
                    <p>The WDC 65C816 supports an 8-channel DMA unit, an 8-bit parallel I/O port a controller port
                        interface circuits allowing serial and parallel access to controller data, a 16-bit multiplication 
                        and division unit, and circuitry for generating non-maskable interrupts on V-blank and IRQ 
                        interrupts on calculated screen positions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The console contains 128 KB of general-purpose "work" RAM, which is separate from the
                      64 KB dedicated to the video subsystem and the 64 KB dedicated to the
                        audio subsystem.

                <h3><span></span>Video</h3>
                <div class="row">
                  <p>The Picture Processing Unit (PPU) consists of two closely tied 
                    IC packages. It contains 64 KB of SRAM for video data, 544 bytes of object 
                    attribute memory (OAM) for sprite data, and 256 x 15 bits of color generator RAM (CGRAM)
                    for palette data. This CGRAM provisions up to 256 colors, 
                    chosen from the 15-bit RGB color space, from a palette of 32,768 colors. 
                    The PPU is clocked by the same signal as the CPU and generates a pixel every two or 
                    four cycles.</p>

                <h3><span></span>Audio</h3>
                <div class="row">
                  <p>The S-SMP audio subsystem consists of a 16-bit digital signal processor (DSP) to sequence 
                    mix samples, an 8-bit SPC700 CPU to drive the DSP, and 64 KB of dedicated PSRAM. It was designed
                    by Ken Kutaragi and produced by Sony and is completely independent from the rest of the system. 
                    It is clocked at a nominal 24.576 MHz in both NTSC and PAL systems. It is capable of stereo sound, 
                    composed from eight voices generated using 16-bit audio samples compressed using BRR and 
                    capable of applying effects such as echo.</p>
